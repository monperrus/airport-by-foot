# Airport by foot

We share instructions on the feasibility and pleasantness of walking to/from airports by foot. Runners and cyclists are also welcome :-)

There is one issue per airport, here is [the list](https://github.com/monperrus/airport-by-foot/issues/):

* [Bromma (BMA) by foot](https://github.com/monperrus/airport-by-foot/issues/1)

You can:

* create a [new issue](https://github.com/monperrus/airport-by-foot/issues/new) for a new airport
* comment on an existing one to add information
